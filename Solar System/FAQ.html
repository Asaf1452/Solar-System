                    Though, not everyone agree with that becouse many people
                    still insist that the Dwarf Planet Pluto, who was considered
                    the ninth planet until it was demoted by the IAU in 2006, is
                    still the ninth planet today. <br />
                    And there is also the theory, due to unexplained
                    gravitational disturbances observed by astronomers, of
                    another so called "Planet Nine" lurking in the outer edges

                    The Solar System formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the
                    collapse of part of a giant molecular cloud that consisted
                    mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth
                    to many other stars. <br />
                    Studies of ancient meteorites indicates that one or more
                    supernovae must have occurred near the location where the
                    Sun formed. <br />
                    A shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered
                    the formation of the Sun

                    A terrestrial planet, telluric planet, or rocky planet, is a
                    planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks or
                    metals.<br />Within the Solar System, the terrestrial
                    planets accepted by the IAU are the inner planets closest to
                    the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. <br />
                    All terrestrial planets in the Solar System have the same
                    basic structure, such as a central metallic core (mostly
                    iron) with a surrounding silicate mantle.

                    In astronomy or planetary science, the Snow Line, also known
                    as the Frost Line or Ice Line, is the particular distance in
                    the solar nebula from the central protostar where it is cold
                    enough for volatile compounds such as water, ammonia,
                    methane, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide to condense
                    into solid ice grains. <br />
                    It is located approximately 5 AU (Astronomical units) from

                    A giant planet is a massive planet and has a thick
                    atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. <br />
                    They may have a dense molten core of rocky elements, or the
                    core may have completely dissolved and dispersed throughout
                    the planet if the planet is hot enough. <br />
                    In "traditional" giant planets such as Jupiter and Saturn
                    (the gas giants) hydrogen and helium constitute most of the
                    mass of the planet, whereas they only make up an outer
                    envelope on Uranus and Neptune, which are instead mostly
                    composed of water, ammonia, and methane and therefore
                    increasingly referred to as "ice giants".

                    The Kuiper belt is a circumstellar disc in the outer Solar
                    System, extending from the orbit of Neptune at 30
                    astronomical units (AU) to approximately 50 AU from the Sun.
                    <br />
                    It is similar to the asteroid belt, but is far larger 20
                    times as wide and 20 to 200 times as massive. <br />
                    Like the asteroid belt, it consists mainly of small bodies
                    or remnants from when the Solar System formed. <br />
                    While many asteroids are composed primarily of rock and
                    metal, most Kuiper belt objects are composed largely of
                    frozen volatiles (termed "ices"), such as methane, ammonia,
                    and water. <br />
                    The Kuiper belt is home to most of the objects that
                    astronomers generally accept as dwarf planets: Orcus, Pluto,
                    Haumea, Quaoar, and Makemake. <br />
                    Some of the Solar System's moons, such as Neptune's Triton
                    and Saturn's Phoebe, may have originated in the region.

                    The Oort cloud is a theoretical concept of a cloud of
                    predominantly icy planetesimals proposed to surround the Sun
                    at distances ranging from 2,000 to 200,000 AU (0.03 to 3.2
                    light-years). <br />
                    It is divided into two regions: a disc-shaped inner Oort
                    cloud (or Hills cloud) and a spherical outer Oort cloud.
                    Both regions lie beyond the heliosphere and are in
                    interstellar space. <br />
                    The Kuiper belt, the scattered disc and the detached
                    objects, the other three reservoirs of trans-Neptunian
